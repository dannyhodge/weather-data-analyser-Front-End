# weather-data-analyser-Front-End
Front end for the weather data analyser project

Tools:
- Angular

Libraries:
- Leaflet
- Mapbox Search
- Ngx-charts
- DayJS

Learning aims:
- Angular services
- Exposure to more libraries
- Comparing Angular to other frameworks

Reflections:
- Angular services make life significantly easier than in React/Vue, where State Management usually required
- Angular libraries can be a pain to work with
- Some things (e.g. chart recalculating) seemed slow, need to see how it performs in other frameworks
